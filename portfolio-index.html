    <article>
      <p>For anyone who may be remotely interested in the web projects of a mere
      beginner, take a look at my code. I started taking a course through the
      University of Washington's Professional and Continuing Education program
      for a <a href="https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/front-end-development-with-html-css-and-javascript">
      certificate on front-end development</a>. The UW has an excellent certificate
      program <a href="https://www.pce.uw.edu/program-finder">(here's a certificate program search)</a>
      for busy professionals who would like to expand their repertoire of skills.</p>

      <p>The program has been surprisingly manageable so far. In the past I have
      learned how to use Dreamweaver, and I had also tried
      to teach myself HTML and CSS a year ago, but I got stuck at some point and
      realized I would need a class to motivate myself to keep learning. Initially
      I felt hesitant about the course (despite being highly proficient with computers
      and having a background in journalism/communications/desktop publishing)
      because I was intimidated by the idea of coding: I was uncertain about my
      ability to absorb the content and time I would need to put into the class.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, the classes have been manageable so far, and the assignments
      have been a lot of fun. Prior to starting this program, I had also finished the
      <a href=https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/editing>Editing certificate program</a>
      at UW in August 2019, and although I enjoyed that program, I am finding the
      front-end development one to be surprisingly more interesting and engaging.</p>

      <p>Join me in my journey and watch how my front-end skills develop through
      the assignments I publish on this page. &#128512</p>
