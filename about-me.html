    <p>Jennifer was born in Bellflower, California, and spent the first 15 years
    her life living primarily in Koreatown. Her Korean immigrant mother, scared
    that her only child would get kidnapped, mugged or shot were she to venture
    out alone, saw to it that her daughter was indoors most of the time, leading Jennifer
    to find her primary source of entertainment in the form of books, TV and radio.</p>

    <p>After 9th grade, her parents moved to the Greater Seattle Area, where she
    finished high school. Nurturing a love of reading and writing that she put
    into practice through her school newspapers, Jennifer continued this activity
    while studying at <a href="https://www.bates.edu">Bates College</a> in Lewiston, Maine, and moved up from contributor
    to staff writer to section layout editor. Abandoning her dreams of
    becoming a doctor (a career she soon realized she would not excel at because
    she was not good enough in math and science and because the profession was not
    well-suited for her personality), she became a history major after getting
    inspired by a professor during her first year of college.</p>

    <p>She proceeded to graduate school at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>
    where she studied print journalism. In retrospect, she realizes this was not
    the greatest choice, but she was aiming to be a magazine journalist at the time.
    While she studied there, she developed a stronger interest in copy editing
    and layout design, realizing she had more interest in these aspects of publishing
    rather than as a writer.</p>

    <p>Graduating in 2007, Jennifer managed to find a contracting job with Microsoft
    back when Bing was known as Live Search. There she worked primarily as a tester
    to rank and compare search engine query results against Bing and its competitors.
    She managed to ride through the Great Recession with this job but found herself
    unemployed after about a year and a half. After six months of unemployment, she decided to live
    and work abroad and ended up going to South Korea to teach English. She lived
    for five years along the northeastern coast where she swam to her heart's content
    and taught primarily at boys schools. After teaching elementary, middle and high
    school for three years, she got a job at a university as a visiting professor.
    After working there for two years, she got a job in Seoul as a curriculum developer
    for one of the largest English teaching companies in Korea. After almost three
    years in Seoul, she finally returned to the States in April 2018.</p>

    <p>Jennifer took advantage of her time abroad and traveled to her heart's content.
    She was not only able to travel around Korea but to Taiwan, Hong Kong (twice),
    Japan (2nd time), Singapore, Thailand, Australia (twice) and New Zealand.</p>

    <p>Wanting to combine her interest in books, editing and reading, she is searching
    for her place back in the States. As she amps up her skills, she tutors on the
    side and is a freelance writer for the <a href="https://iexaminer.org/author/jennifer-lee">International Examiner</a>,
    a nonprofit, independent paper that focuses on the Asian American/Pacific Islander
    community in the Pacific Northwest. She used to work part-time at
    Barnes & Noble and worked as a marketing intern at <a href="https://nwfilmforum.org">Northwest Film Forum</a>,
    but she stopped doing those activities after almost a year in June 2019.</p>

    <p>Jennifer hopes to one day find a job that could collaborate all her interests:
    editing, writing, layout design and advising/mentorship.</p>
